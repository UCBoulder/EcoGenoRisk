Introduction
============
EcoGenoRisk a risk assessment tool designed to assess the risk a synthetic organism can introduce into the environment. 

EcoGenoRisk is composed of HazID, EnvCen, and RiskQ(under development).

**HazID**
=========
Utilizes DIAMOND sequence aligner to run a functional comparison of a synbio organism against all known organisms. 

Outputs the most susceptible organism to competition. 

**EnCen**
=========
Biome specific functional analysis

Runs on DIAMOND and JGI to identify most susceptible biome to invasion across multiple biome inputs 

Allows for deep dive into bin lineage and enzymatic effect of synbio invasion on any given environment
